# hte-console changes

New HTE code (AGPL-3.0), not a change to upstream. The fork-level statement is `../HTE.md`.

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-24): phase 1, the device endpoints

- `serve` with `HTE_CONSOLE_DATABASE` answers `POST /api/heartbeat`, `/api/sysinfo`, `/api/audit/conn`,
  `/api/audit/file`, `/api/audit/alarm` and `GET /api/version` itself, on the PHP console's SQLite file (WAL,
  busy timeout, foreign keys; no schema change). Ported from v1.15.0-hte.1: `SyncController`, the tokenless half of
  `AuditController`, `Strategy` (resolution and delivery), `DeviceEnrollment` (approval gate, default group,
  approval by a signed-in client), the presence marker of `CheckDeviceNotifications::reportOnline`, and HTE's
  password hook (`App\Hte\Passwords`: `hte_pw`, issue, confirm, book entries, the password sealed with
  `crypto_box_seal` to the device's ed25519 key from hbbs's `peer` table). Everything else is forwarded as in 0.0.x.
- PHP and Laravel semantics as a library (`php.rs`, `laravel.rs`), so answers to bad input are PHP's own.
- Hardening: 1 MiB body cap, the `device-sync` rate limit, no panics on input (a seeded fuzz test), bound
  parameters only, no secrets in logs, refuses to start under a uid that would leave WAL files PHP cannot write.
- `hte-console snapshot <sqlite>`; `replay.sh` replays against PHP and hte-console and compares the databases.
- Synthetic fixtures 009-024 (bad input, audit paths); raw request bodies in synthetic fixtures.
- Graceful stop on SIGTERM. Image built with `cross` (libsodium, SQLite).
- Not ported: Apprise notifications; multipart bodies.

## 0.0.2 (2026-10-24)

Status tokens recorded as text, replay classifies replies like capture, several fixture directories, a built-in
"does the replay notice a change" check, eight synthetic fixtures, extra seed SQL, the default strategy derived
from captured answers.

## 0.0.1 (2026-10-24): phase 0, the shadow proxy

Forwards every request to PHP and returns its answer unchanged; records sanitised fixtures (`SANITISER.md`);
`scan`, `seed-sql`, `replay`, `replay/replay.sh`.
